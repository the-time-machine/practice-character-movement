Player Movement Practice

As my first mini learning project, I created and animated a player character. Their move, jump and dash speeds are adjustable as serialized fields. 
Player Controls:
Jump: Space
Dash: Left-Shift
Move: Arrows or WASD
Attack: H

There's a pacing enemy that does nothing. Added them for practice. 
They do have a line of sight that sees the player and launches a Debug.Log, but does nothing. I got lazy when it came to making their attackSight its own check / component, so
we need to jump to be seen.
